# DS-Lab

## Update
Up to week 5 (Lab 3 & 4)
1. For the `extra-question.md` in `lab 2`, due to several reasons (question not clear, haven't learn `linkedlist`), I reconstruct the question a bit and put it in `lab 3`, `RandomGenerator.ipynb` file.
2. `QnA.md` for `lab 2` I don't have enough time to update so maybe I will update in future.
4. Added a new `discussion.md` for lab 3 questions.
5. Added a new challenge question `Set-Q.ipynb`.
6. Added code for LinkedList in Lab 4.
7. For data structure visualization: [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en)

## About
The main purpose of this repo is to let you explore more aside from what you learnt in DS class.\
Also, as requested, I will also upload some concept you may used to answer your lab questions.\
To clarify, I won't upload full code here as you are the one should figure it out. =) \
If you have any question, can try raise issue in this repo and I will try my best to find time to answer you. \
I will update/check this repo irregularly, because sometimes I might forget when I am busy.
