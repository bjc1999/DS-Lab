## About
The main purpose of this repo is to let you explore more aside from what you learnt in DS class.\
Also, as requested, I will also upload some concept you may used to answer your lab questions.\
To clarify, I won't upload full code here as you are the one should figure it out. =) \
If you have any question, can try raise issue in this repo and I will try my best to find time to answer you. \
I will update/check this repo irregularly, because sometimes I might forget when I am busy.
