# DS-Lab

## Update
Up to week 9
1. Good luck for tomorrow lab test 2!
2. Since the lab test 2 is about `Stack`, should you have any problem regarding `Stack` before your lab test, can raise your question here.
3. Be sure you know how to create a `Stack` to store class objects, i.e. `Stack<Book>` or for Generic class objects it will be something like `Stack<Dishes<String, Integer>>`.
4. I don't think there is enough time for us to discuss Lab 7 Queue tomorrow during lab session, so if you have any questions please also raising them here first.
5. `Stack`'s nature is **L**ast-**I**n-**F**irst-**O**ut (LIFO) while `Queue`'s nature is **F**irst-**I**n-**F**irst-**O**ut (FIFO), there are many real world applications that are following the nature of either of them, so be sure you are familiar with `Stack` and `Queue`.

## About
The main purpose of this repo is to let you explore more aside from what you learnt in DS class.\
Also, as requested, I will also upload some concept you may used to answer your lab questions.\
To clarify, I won't upload full code here as you are the one should figure it out. =) \
If you have any question, can try raise issue in this repo and I will try my best to find time to answer you. \
I will update/check this repo irregularly, because sometimes I might forget when I am busy.
