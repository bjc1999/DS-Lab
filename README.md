# DS-Lab

## Update
Up to week 4 (Lab 3)
1. For the `extra-question.md` in `lab 2`, due to several reasons (question not clear, haven't learn `linkedlist`), I reconstruct the question a bit and put it in `lab 3`, `RandomGenerator.ipynb` file.
2. `QnA.md` for `lab 2` I don't have enough time to update so maybe I will update in future.
3. Wish you all good luck for this week **lab test**!

## About
The main purpose of this repo is to let you explore more aside from what you learnt in DS class.\
Also, as requested, I will also upload some concept you may used to answer your lab questions.\
To clarify, I won't upload full code here as you are the one should figure it out. =) \
If you have any question, can try raise issue in this repo and I will try my best to find time to answer you. \
I will update/check this repo irregularly, because sometimes I might forget when I am busy.
