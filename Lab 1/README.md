Here is some resources related to concept used in Lab 1. \
\
FileIO:
1. FileReader / Writer is mainly for text only.
2. FileInput / Output Stream is for any contents (it reads in bytes).
3. Buffered means create buffer and extract files from disk to buffer first, then only we read the contents from buffer.
4. If didn't wrap with buffered means directly reading from disk.
5. Both have pros and cons.
