## Dynamic Bag
*Modification of Lab 3 Q1*

1. Instead of specifying a capacity for your `BagInterface`, please try `BagInterface` with unlimited size (aka. dynamic size).
2. The bag size should auto scale up when it reaches current max capacity.
3. Ths bag size should also auto scale down when too much 'empty slots' left unused (when bunch of items are remove from the bag).

*Discussion of Lab 3 Q2-4*

2. Explore different ways to enforce this condition.
